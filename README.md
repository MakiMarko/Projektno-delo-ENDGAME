# Project: Cyclist and Motorist Detection System
Artificial intelligence in autonomous driving

Project group: ENDGAME

Idea: We have developed a system to detect motorists and cyclists on the road. Using video recordings, the system flags a cyclist or motorcyclist using the YOLO algorithm and alerts drivers to their presence. The system marks the detected objects, displays the overtaking status (side frame), and warns of danger if the object gets too close (front and rear frame).

Check the Wiki pages for more project details.
